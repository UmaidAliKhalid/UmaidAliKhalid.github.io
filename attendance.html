  <hr>
  <div class="bar"><p>This attendance system lets students mark themselves present in class. Before a student can mark him/herself present, he/she will have to pass two tests. The first test regards an IP Address check. This test checks whether or not the student is in school or not. The second test has to do with a random number that will be provided by the professor during class. If the number entered by the student matches the number generated by the professor, then the student will be marked present.  </p></div>
